# Bada-Boom
Beat Em' Up I worked on for Game Development I
Game Code Written by Luis Rangel (luisrangel.person@gmail.com) and Alfredo Deleon
Original Engine written by Dr. Ian Parberry
Game made for 4210-Game Developent I at the University of North Texas

This code was uploaded to GitHub so others can see it, please don't steal without giving credit. I am but a humble student.

Bada Boom!! was made using Visual C++, Direct X 11, and Visual Studio 2015. Revision control was handled by a subversion SVN server. 
This game is a linear Beat em' Up starring Gatling Gator, a disgrunted office employee looking to take revenge on his boss for stealing his ideas!
Your goal is to make it as far up the building as you can without dying!
I programmed the random level generator, created the player character, changed the collsion from merely checking the distance to using multiple hitboxes.
I made 80% of the art for the game using a sprite making app called Sprite Something, enabled pausing, and I programmed the HUD.

I would like to add that the game was made using goofy sprites as the game is comedic in nature, its an alligator beating his way up an office building, ain't meant to be serious.

The level generator is the part I am most proud of, It generates floors based off a tile based grid and it makes sure the tiles are spawned in appropriate places.
It also generates enemies according to how high the floor number is to make sure the game gets harder. 
It was a novel idea to create an infinite beat em up to use as a stress relief tool. 
There are break rooms that spawn to give the player time to breathe, and there is a secret room that has a 1/8192 chance of spawning.

I wish we were able to use a proper game engine for this game, like Unity, but we did the best we could and the game was a hit with our class.
